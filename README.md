# Probabilistic-U-Net-Segmentation-Ambiguous-Images-
People with pulmonary disease often have a high opacity, which makes segmentation of the lung from chest X-rays more difficult. In this study, I propose a methodology to improve the performance of the U-NET structure so that it is able to extract the features and spatial characteristics of the X-ray images of the chest region.
